# Portfolio

This portfolio is designed to be employer competitive, speaking to personal strengths and skill sets aquired and applied in my current job and my journey in Monash University's Bootcamp. Recently updated to include projects, an employer competitive resume, github profile and LinkedIn profile. 

I have utilized a variety of CSS Frameworks including Bootstrap and Semantic UI.
