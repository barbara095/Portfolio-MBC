# Portfolio

This portfolio is designed to be employer competitive, speaking to personal strengths and skill sets acquired and applied in my current job in Market Research, and from my journey in Monash University's Bootcamp. Recently updated to include projects, an employer competitive resume, github profile and LinkedIn profile. 

I have utilized a variety of CSS Frameworks including Bootstrap and Semantic UI.
