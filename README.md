# Updated Portfolio

This portfolio is updated to include recent projects undertaken in the Monash Coding Bootcamp to date, with the addition of an updated resume, github profile and LinkedIn profile. 

The portfolio is organised as follows:
- 3 pages: About Me, My portfolio, Contact Me. 
- 1 CSS styling sheet was used to style the pages.
- I utilised Bootstrap to incorporate items such as a navbar, contact form, cards, grid layouts and a sticky footer on all pages - to ensure it stays fixed irrespective of where you are on the page.
