My bootcamp portfolio

For this assignment, I created a set of 3 HTML styling sheets corresponding to each page on my website, with 1 CSS styling sheet used to style the pages' attributes. 

- I utilised Bootstrap to incorporate items such as a navbar, contact form, grid layouts and sticky footer which stays fixed when you scroll on the page. 
- I used the Bootstrap grid system to set the column and row widths. For example, in my About Me page, I set the column width for all contents as '8' with my child elements falling underneath: My biography was set at '9' and my profile picture as '3.'
- I made all pages responsive on both small and large screens specified in the meta tag at the top of each HTML sheet. 
- Each page is styled using one CSS stylesheet, which lists the styles in sequential order. 
- All images are referenced with a tags
