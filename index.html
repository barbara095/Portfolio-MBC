            <p>
              I work in market research with an academic background in Marketing and Business Management. 
              People often describe me as curious, ambitious and patient, which is why I've taken an interest in 
              learning the wonderfully complex language of coding.  </p>
            <p>I like to travel to both warm and cold places. My favourite destinations are Greece, which is my background, 
              Aspen Colorado, New York and the Fijian islands. My dream one day is to live and work somewhere warm and central like Hawaii so
              I can be closer to places such as Europe and America. In my spare time I enjoy socialising, exercising including strength training, running and bike 
              riding. I love cooking, and especially enjoy making warm apple pie/crumble. My guilty pleasures include ice-cream, pizza and cheesecake of any varietal.
            </p>
            <p>So far I am really enjoying the challenge and satisfaction of coding, which has tested my patience and reactivated certain regions of my left brain hemisphere, as I 
              am usually one who exercises creative thinking and writing. But as I trust the process, I hope to one day work as a professional in the field of Web development, 
              utilising both my creative and mathematical skills learnt throughout this coding course, and to work up towards becoming a full stack developer with more experience and practice.
            </p>
